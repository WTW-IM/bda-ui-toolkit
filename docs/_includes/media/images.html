  <p>From the Via Benefits style guide:</p>
  <blockquote class="block-large">
    <p>Most of the photographic images used in participant-facing materials will fall into two camps: pathways (shot at eye level) and people. A library of licensed images for both styles is available.</p>
    <p>In most cases, a pathway image should be the first thing that participants see in our materials&mdash;on a brochureâ€™s cover, for instance. These pathways are shot at eye level to remind readers of their own personal journeys. Because they are conceptual images, a little goes a long way. Use them sparingly; for instance, as section dividers in a PowerPoint deck. (Note: These eye-level pathways are reserved exclusively for participant-facing materials, and are intentionally different from the aerial pathway images used in employer-facing materials.)</p>
    <p>People images bring warmth and humanity to our participant materials. Our photo library includes portraits of employees and retirees. When designing materials, take care to choose images that reflect the diversity of our participants.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The images below are a representative sample. Refer to the WTW photo library to see the full selection.</p>
  
  <h2 id="images-retina">Retina images</h2>
  <p>Now that Exchange Solutions has dropped support for all browsers can't handle the <code>background-size</code> CSS property, it is recommendded that all raster images be retina-compatible. This essentially means raster images should be output at <em>at least</em> twice their client-rendered dimensions, and then contstrained using the <code>height</code> and/or <code>width</code> CSS properties &mdash; or <code>background-size</code> property for background-images.</p>
  <div class="bs-example bs-example-retina-images" data-example-id="retina-images">
    <p>Here is a sample carrier logo, at its native resolution:</p>
    <img src="../assets/img/arches-health-plan.gif" alt="arches health plan" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>Here is the same image, constrained to 50% of its native dimensions:</p>
    <img src="../assets/img/arches-health-plan.gif" alt="arches health plan" style="height: 75px; margin-bottom: 20px; width 220px;">
    <p>If you're on a Retina (or device of similarly high pixel density) device, you should see an appreciable difference in image quality between the two examples above.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 id="images-responsive">Responsive images</h2>
  <p>"Responsive" means that the image scales to the size (height, width, or both) of its parent container. Images should be rendered responsively where appropriate.</p>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="callout-images-ie-svg">
    <h4>SVG images and IE 8-10</h4>
    <p>In Internet Explorer 8-10, SVG images using the <code>.img-responsive</code> class are disproportionately sized. To fix this, add <code>width: 100% \9;</code> where necessary. The framework doesn't apply this automatically, as it causes complications to other image formats.</p>
