  <p class="lead">Health care and finances are both data-heavy aspects of modern life. Put them together, and ... ? Hoo, boy&mdash;that's a lot of data! Visualizations to the rescue!</p>
  <p>The most common form of data visualization has been around for a looong time: charts!</p>
  <p>We recommend using colors from the WTW Tertiary color palette, as they are bold and stand out well in chunks, like those you would see in several types of charts.</p>
  
  <h3>Bar Charts</h3>
  <p>A bar chart is a way of showing data as bars. It is sometimes used to show trend data, and the comparison of multiple data sets side by side.</p>

  <h3>Line Charts</h3>
  <p>A line chart is a way of plotting data points on a line. Often, it is used to show trend data, and the comparison of two data sets.</p>

  <h3>Pie &amp; Doughnut Charts</h3>
  <p>Pie charts are probably the most commonly used chart there are. They are divided into segments, the arc of each segment shows the proportional value of each piece of data. Doughnut charts are identical to pie charts, but have a cutout in the canter, rendring the data segments as arcs.</p>
  <p>They are excellent at showing the relational proportions between data.</p>
  <p>Additionally, doughnut charts offer the benefit of space to include meta information pertaining to the data set, such as an aggregate total. Example: total monthly expenditure in the center, and a breakdown of proportions by type in the surrounding arcs.</p>

  <!--<h3>Radar Charts</h3>-->
  <!--<p>A radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and the variation between them. They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.</p>-->

  <!--<h3>Polar Area Charts</h3>-->
  <!--<p>Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value.</p>-->
  <!--<p>This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.</p>-->
