  <h2 id="videos" class="page-header">Videos</h2>
  <p>In our line of work, videos usually serve one of two purposes &mdash; instructional/informative or decorative. This isn't to say that they shouldn't be somewhat entertaining, if appropriate... but good luck getting a kitten to talk about benefits!</p>
  
  <h3>Instructional/Informational Videos</h3>
  <p>We're not going to tell you how you should produce or edit instructional videos. That's up to you, but here are our recommendations for how to lay out gallery pages:</p>
  
  <h4>Rows</h4>
  <p>A row-based layout puts more emphasis on text &mdash; unless you want the thumbnails to be larger, and have fewer "items" fit within a browser's viewport at a given time.</p>
  <p>The example layout uses a small thumbnail (that launches the video), 5 lines of text (truncated with an ellipsis), and a "Play Video" button (just to cover the bases).</p>
  <a href="/vid-rows.html" class="btn btn-default btn-large" target="_blank">See Rows Layout</a>

  <h4>Tiles</h4>
  <p>A tile-based layout puts more emphasis on thumbnails, where they can be a bit larger. The text needs to be truncated a little smaller, unless you want to have fewer "items" fit within a browser's viewport at a given time.</p>

  <h3>Decorative Video</h3>
  <p>We've all seen decorative videos on various sites &mdash; from PayPal, to Airbnb, to our very own!</p>
  <p>Make sure decorative videos are hidden from screen readers, as they do not contribute to the information users are seeking. Be sure to balance quality with size to make sure videos both load quickly and look decent behind your content.</p>
