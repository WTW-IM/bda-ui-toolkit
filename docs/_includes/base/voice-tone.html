  <h2 id="voice-tone" class="page-header">Voice &amp; Tone</h2>

  <p>Our distinct voice and tone make messaging recognizable. It helps our participants understand who we are, what services we provide, and how we can help them.</p>

  <p>All BDA communications should strive for uniformity in voice and tone across all participant communication channels.</p>
  
  <p>Our tone of voice (when speaking to participants) can be encapsulated with the following passage:</p>
  
  <blockquote>Via Benefits has the experience, knowledge, and ability to help you through the process of managing and maintaining your health care coverage. We sincerely want to make the process as straightforward and simple as possible. We are your advisers and advocates, guiding you through the complexities of the health care marketplace.</blockquote>
  
  <p>The BDA voice and tone <strong>are</strong>:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Warm and friendly without being too casual</li>
    <li>Active, confident, instructional
      <ul>
        <li>Wherever possible, replace indirect statements (you may, you might, it could be good if) with strong, positive statements (you can, you have the option to, you can choose to). We want to provide a language of agency so the reader understands the
          options.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Professional and authoritative; knowledgeable</li>
    <li>Neutral and unbiased</li>
    <li>Clear and concise
      <ul>
        <li>We strive to keep the language at a 5th grade reading level, with the addition of health care terminology (e.g., deductible, copay, coinsurance)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Empathetic and understanding</li>
    <li>Trustworthy</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The BDA voice and tone <strong>are not</strong>:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Boastful
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using superlatives (e.g., best, greatest)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Condescending or bossy</li>
    <li>Flippant or casual</li>
    <li>Cold and removed, overly “corporate”</li>
    <li>Full of slang or industry jargon
      <ul>
        <li>If necessary, add a definition that is clear and easily understood. Make no assumptions about what you think people should know or understand implicitly. Avoid acronyms (without explanation).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Passive or vague
      <ul>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Subjective or biased toward an insurance company or a type of people (e.g., people who are more computer savvy)</li>
  </ul>
