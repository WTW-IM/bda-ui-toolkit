  <p class="lead">One of the single biggest ways to achieve coherent branding across multiple properties&mdash;without compromising on elements like global navigation, etcetera&mdash;is with the footer.</p>
  
  <p>To maintain coherence, it is recommended that you keep links to 4 - 5, floated left, inline with one another. Place the copyright information in a container that is floated right with <code>text-align: right;</code> applied, with the Willis Towers Watson logo below.</p>
